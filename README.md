# Ninja-Restaurant
Ninja Restaurant is an application that customers can buy meals from my local restaurant. This application is designed not to only have fun and enjoy implementing functionalities, but also for me to get more familiar with classes, implementation files, and using vectors to hold all struct variables. 

I made a text file that includes the food category, food names, and their prices. You are welcome to pull this respository and run this app. You can also change the food items and prices if you wish to do so.

Before you edit the text file. Follow this format:
1. Food Category
2. Food Name
3. Food Price
4. (Space)

You have to follow this format or else you will get an error when it runs. For example, if you forgot to add a space between the last price of the food and the food category. You will receive a run-time error when the program is trying to convert a string-double to a string, but actually you programmed some strings (food names) to be converted into a double. Go to the NinjaRestaurant.cpp file and addFood() to see how the program reads all string values from the ninjaFood.txt file.

I used Xcode to run the program, but when I tried to use my terminal to run the program, I get a compiler error. If you have any suggestions, feel free to comment.
